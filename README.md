## Matching Engine

When you want to buy or sell an order you are placing an order on an exchange. The matching engine from that exchange is taking your order and tries to match it with the given orderbook.

`Asks` defines if you want to buy an asset.
`Bids` defines if you want to sell something.

The mid-market price is the average price build from the best bids and best asks.

Spread is the difference between the highest buyers bid and the lowest sellers ask.

A `maker` is somebody who places a limit order to buy an assset.

When you want to buy an asset directly as fast as possible you would define a `market order` which would execute at the current price. Those orders do remove, fill or take orders from the order book. Somebody like that is also called a `taker`. When you execute such an order, you are taking away an amount of ask orders 

A `match` is representing one counterparty which is at least partially matching the order
